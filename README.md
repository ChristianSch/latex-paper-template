# LaTeX Paper Template
This template provides a basic environment to produce academic papers or similar kinds of texts.

## Usage
The template was developed under OS X. Therefore you might have to edit the `Makefile` slightly to fit the commands to your LaTeX distribution or operating system.

Please note that if the `biblatex` command does not produce valid output (which is part of the `make` or `make all` command) due to errors in your bibliography might block running `make` after that. To fix this please use the `make clean` command to remove all generated files.
